# About This Project

## Project Overview

**AI-Powered Systematic Review Tools for Free Water Diffusion MRI Studies** is an advanced research automation toolkit designed to accelerate and standardize systematic literature reviews in neuroimaging research. This project combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with robust PDF processing technologies to extract structured data from scientific publications focusing on free water diffusion MRI methodologies.

## Background & Motivation

### The Challenge

Systematic literature reviews are the gold standard for evidence synthesis in medical research, but they face significant challenges:

- **Volume**: With thousands of papers published annually in neuroimaging, manual screening becomes overwhelming
- **Consistency**: Human reviewers may interpret inclusion criteria differently, leading to selection bias
- **Data Extraction**: Manually extracting structured data from hundreds of papers is time-intensive and error-prone
- **Reproducibility**: Traditional reviews are difficult to replicate due to subjective decision-making processes

### Free Water Diffusion MRI

Free water diffusion MRI is an advanced neuroimaging technique that:
- Measures water molecules freely diffusing in tissue
- Provides insights into brain microstructure and pathology
- Shows promise for early disease detection in neurological conditions
- Requires specialized analysis methods and quantitative metrics

The rapid growth of this field necessitates systematic approaches to synthesize findings across studies.

## Technical Innovation

### Multi-Modal AI Approach

This toolkit employs multiple AI models to leverage their complementary strengths:

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Superior text comprehension and nuanced reasoning
- **Gemini (Google)**: Fast processing with excellent table understanding  
- **OpenAI GPT**: Balanced performance across various tasks

### Hybrid PDF Processing

The project pioneered a hybrid extraction approach that combines:

1. **Docling**: Advanced PDF-to-structured-data conversion with table extraction
2. **PyMuPDF**: Comprehensive text extraction for capturing embedded values
3. **Intelligent Merging**: Field-specific prioritization to optimize data quality

### Key Technical Features

- **Automated Paper Screening**: AI-driven include/exclude decisions based on standardized criteria
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Converts unstructured PDF content into standardized CSV format
- **Template-Based Output**: Ensures consistency across all extracted studies
- **Quality Validation**: Multiple extraction methods with intelligent result merging
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Version-controlled processes with detailed audit trails

## Research Impact

### Academic Significance

This project addresses critical needs in evidence-based medicine:

- **Accelerated Reviews**: Reduces systematic review timelines from months to days
- **Improved Consistency**: Standardized AI-driven decisions eliminate reviewer bias
- **Enhanced Reproducibility**: Fully documented and version-controlled processes
- **Data Quality**: Extracts actual numerical values from tables rather than text references

### Methodological Contributions

1. **Hybrid Extraction Framework**: Novel combination of multiple PDF processing approaches
2. **AI Model Ensemble**: First application of multiple AI models for systematic review automation
3. **Field-Specific Prioritization**: Intelligent merging based on data type characteristics
4. **Template-Driven Extraction**: Standardized output format for meta-analysis compatibility
